#### The Grand Tour Project, directed by Giovanna Ceserani of Stanford, maps the travels of British and Irish architects throughout Italy.With the information compiled from the “Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800”, the site offers many visuals to help illustrate the movement of architects through Italian cities. The site is split into the modules respectively titled “home”, “about”, “people”, “publication”, “interact”, “workshops”, and “news”.

#### In terms of usability, this project was very accessible on the computer and the phone with the exception of a few aspects. The project is user friendly and informative, but is limited by a few unclear visuals. The main feature of this digital humanities project is the interact module, so clarity is especially important. However, I found that some of the graphs were lacking clarity. Firstly, while there are written descriptions of each interactive graph, there still is a learning curve, as no further instruction is given. Another issue I have with the interactive visuals is the moving clusters in the educational background and funding graphs. The names in these data sets tend to overlap each other and make the information hard to read. While these moving information clusters are fun to interact with, they take away from the clarity of the information. The only other issue I have with the interact module is that the “Map of Architects Travels” doesn’t include much information, just the popularity of certain destinations with no key, and there isn’t much interaction to be done with the map. However, the simplicity of this graph is also a strength, as it provides a different perspective on the Grand Tour through limiting the information. Some aspects of the Grand Tour project that elevate the user experience are the “people” and “publications” modules. The “people” module provides personal websites for all team members, and “publications” lists Grand Tour articles that the team has written, mainly Ceserani. As for how the project performs on a mobile device, I found that all the functions worked the same and fit the screen well. There was slight crowding of words at some points, specifically the “Timechart of Architects’ Travels”, but I think they did a good job considering the amount of data points in that chart. Overall, I find that the project is easy to use and the site composed in a very aesthetically pleasing way.

#### The home page has a brief introduction and mission statement. Upon scrolling down, you can find links to other aspects of the project that the creators felt needed to be highlighted, specifically the interact module, a class that Stanford offers on the Grand Tour, and a publication of this project in the American Historical Review. The next module is the “About” page of this website. This page gives background information about the project itself, then about the Grand Tour, and finally, the digital aspect of the project. The next module, “People”, gives contact information for the team Ceserani assembled. As previously mentioned, the interact module is the main feature of the project, the purpose of which is “to create a dynamic searchable database, along with digital visualizations of these travelers’ journeys and lives,” as stated in the home page. The interact module offers data visualizations of the “Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800”, which derived its information from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells in 1997. Said data visualizations are a “Time Chart of Architects’ Travels”, a “Map of Architects’ Travels”, a “Graph of Architects’ Educational background”, a “Graph of Architects’ Funding”, and “Architects’ Data Viewer.” These five graphs’ use information about sixty-nine architects taken out of 5213 entries from the Brinsley Ford Archive. After “interact” we have “workshops” and “news”, which have workshop availabilities and news coverage of this project respectively.

#### I find this project to be very successful. Save for the few issues I found with the interactive displays, the site had a natural composition which made exploring the Grand Tour through these data points a fun activity.
