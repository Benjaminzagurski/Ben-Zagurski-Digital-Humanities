#### The Grand Tour (TGT) was a Stanford study of the travels of British and Irish architects throughout Italy. Project director Giovanna Ceserani and his team from the “Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800.” TGT offers many visuals to help illustrate the movement of architects through Italian cities. The team has split the information into 5 modules titled: “home”, “about”, “people”, “publication”, “interact”, “workshops”, and “news”.

#### In terms of usability, this project is very accessible on the computer and the phone, except for a few aspects. The project is user friendly and informative, but is limited by a few unclear visuals. The main feature of this digital humanities project is the interact module. Thus, clarity is especially important for the interactive graphs, something many of the graphs lack. While there are written descriptions of each interactive graph, there still is a learning curve, as no further instruction is given. Another issue I have with the interactive section is confusing visuals. I found the moving clusters in the education and funding graphs disorderly. The names in these data sets tend to overlap each other and make the information hard to read. While said information clusters are fun to interact with, they reduce the clarity of the information. Additionally, the “Map of Architects Travels” doesn’t include much information, just the popularity of certain destinations. This graph doesn’t have a key, and there isn’t much interaction to be done with the map. Clicking on the red bubbles only shows the number of travelers who visited each city. However, the simplicity of this graph is also a strength, as limiting the data creates the strongest visual on the site.

#### Several features elevate the user experience, such as the “people” and “publications” modules. The former provides personal websites for all team members, and the later lists Grand Tour articles written by the team. As for how the project performs on a mobile device, I found that all the functions worked the same and fit the screen well. There was slight crowding of words at some points, specifically the “Timechart of Architects’ Travels”, but I think they did a good job considering the amount of data points in that chart. Overall, I find the composition of the project aesthetically pleasing and the information clear.

#### The home page has a brief introduction and mission statement. Upon scrolling down, you can find links to other aspects of the project that the creators felt needed to be highlighted, specifically the interact module, a class that Stanford offers on the Grand Tour, and a publication of this project in the American Historical Review. The next module is the “About” page of this website. This page gives background information about the project itself, then about the Grand Tour, and finally, the digital aspect of the project. The next module, “People”, gives contact information for the team Ceserani assembled. As previously mentioned, the interact module is the main feature of the project, the purpose of which is “to create a dynamic searchable database, along with digital visualizations, of these travelers’ journeys and lives,” as stated in the home page. The interact module offers data visualizations of the “Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800”, which derived its information from the Brinsley Ford Archive by John Ingamells in 1997. Said data visualizations are a “Time Chart of Architects’ Travels”, a “Map of Architects’ Travels”, a “Graph of Architects’ Educational background”, a “Graph of Architects’ Funding”, and “Architects’ Data Viewer.” These five graphs’ use information about sixty-nine architects taken out of 5213 entries from the Brinsley Ford Archive. After “interact” we have “workshops” and “news”, which have workshop availabilities and news coverage of this project respectively.

#### I find this project to be very successful. Save for the few issues I found with the interactive displays, the site had a natural layout which made exploring the Grand Tour through these data points a fun activity.
