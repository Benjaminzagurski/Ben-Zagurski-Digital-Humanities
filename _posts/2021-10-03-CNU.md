### My CNU project was focused on things I do with consistency while at CNU. The modules I used consist of cool landmarks on campus, places pertaining to my academic and personal interests, as well as my dorm halls throughout the years. 

### For the landmarks, I used 2 of the fountains on campus, the whisper wall, and the bell tower. The fountains are an interesting landmark on campus that create a soothing ambient noise. I like to go to the whisper wall to sit and do homework sometimes. While my experiences with these other spots on campus is entirely positive, the bell tower, which is located in front of the whisper wall, normally means I’m late for class. 

### As for academic and personal interests, I spend most of my time either in the Freeman Center or in the Torgler Center. Fitness and art are both life long passions of mine. When I was a child, I was very skilled at art, as I still am, and therefore, I put a lot of work into my art. Similarly, I always played sports growing up, and began lifting after high school. Since then, I spend more and more time in the gym. 

### The remainder of the modules are related to the dorm halls I stayed in throughout my time at CNU. My favorite so far would have to be Jefferson on East campus.

### Making this project using Thinglink was a lot easier than I expected. I found the controls to be very user friendly, which I was a bit worried about. I think my favorite aspect of Thinglink are the tags. The tags, which are the main function of the site, allow the user to insert content, such as images, video, audio, and text into the CNU map that we were provided. This was an excellent tool to convey information in a way that maintains the viewer’s attention.

### My only complaint with Thinglink was the lack of color choices for the tags. While there are many icons you can use, there are very limited options when I comes to color. This was a challenge for me, as some of the icons are either bound to repeat in color or blend in with the background.

### All in all, Thinglink was an easy and fun tool to use. I will continue to use this site in future projects, as the interactive and visual formatting of the information conveys information that is very easy to digest.
